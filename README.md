# collisionengine

a test repository to create an effective collision engine.
current state is a spatial segmentation algorithm, reducing collision checks to checks on neighbouring cells of an object. utilizing a regular grid of the size of an object.
requires sfml.

current way forward: implement k-2-tree to speed up collision findings
